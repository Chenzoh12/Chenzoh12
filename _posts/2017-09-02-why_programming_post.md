For as long as I can remember I have been extremely interested in technology. My intrigue was with the tech world in general, not solely computers. From cell-phones and
video games to palm-pilots and desktop computers, I enjoyed playing with it all. Nobody in my immediate family is overly tech-savvy, but my mother had a keen sense of the
direction our society was heading in. She constantly instilled in me “You have to do _something_ with computers. That’s where all of the jobs will be.”  When it was time
to choose a major it seemed more like a reaction more than a decision…Computer Science!

As I stepped foot on campus for my first semester of college I had three labels: Freshman, Division 1 Ice Hockey player,
Computer Science major. I recall thinking to myself, “How hard can it possibly be to balance my athletic commitments, a
challenging major and a social life? I quickly discovered the answer: **extremely hard**. Ice hockey required a **minimum**
commitment of 4-5 hours a day. Between hockey and classes I was already burning the candle at both ends and my social life was
essentially non-existent. Soon after that realization I quickly had another wake-up call: computer science is not your typical
major. I could not just study for the quizzes and exams a few days prior, but instead, much like hockey, I had to dedicate time
to _practice_ my skills in order to master the craft. By the start of my second semester of college I had officially made the
decision to become a Business Administration major with a concentration in Finance. A decision that was the correct decision for
my situation at the time, but a decision I would come to regret.

Fast forward to May of 2016 and I find myself a college graduate accepting a position to become an analyst with a publicly
traded, industry leading, $20 billion dollar company: Equinix. As with most entry-level positions within large organizations,
most of the _grunt_ work inevitably ended up falling to our elite team of entry-level _minions_. We were given 100’s of identical
templates a day, each of which needed to be analyzed, corrected and processed. One template, depending on size, could take
anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour to complete from start to finish. After about a week of this monotonous routine I approached
a fellow minion and asked him to cover my workload for three days. I told him, despite only having one semester of computers
science experience, I was fairly confident I could fully automate this process using VBA and PowerShell and that if successful
would give him credit when presenting the finished product to our managers.  A few months later I found myself in my manager’s
office to accept a promotion. My script saved the company over $20,000 in the first 3 months and is still used to this day. Right
then I knew I wanted to get back into software developing. I just needed to decided how and when.  That was the moment when I
officially committed to pursue a career in software development…take 2!
