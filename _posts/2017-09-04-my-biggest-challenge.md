End users of an application often times do not have a strong understanding of what goes on behind the scenes of said application. From their perspective the
application's functionality might as well be powered by some form of sorcery. They click a button here, type a word there and the screen updates accordingly…magic! I was a
member of this group up until I began my programming education. Sure, given my history with technology I knew that it was not magic, but I had no idea how complicated it
could be to bring even the simplest of tasks to life.

As I began to develop applications of my own I quickly realized that everything I wanted my application to do had already been done by 50 programmers using 50
different methods. What is the correct method? What is the best-practice? What is most efficient? Does it matter? The information available to us in today’s society is
limitless and instantly at our fingertips. The biggest challenge I have faced in my programming career to date has been finding the correct source, analyzing it to find
specifically what I need and implementing that information in a manner that will work for my objectives.

Google has been my best friend in the early stages of my programming education. It is, however, extremely easy to get overwhelmed given the amount of information that
is available on the internet today. One StackOverFlow search result can offer _dozens_ of answers each of which works in its own way. Initially, it seemed like common
sense to utilize the solution with the most up votes. Over time, however, I realized that the answer a few replies down could be perfectly suited for my particular needs
and a lot less complicated to implement… so why not? I would often times second guess myself and wonder why this wasn't the **best** solution. Is my code going to appear
sloppy, or inefficient, if I use this answer I found on the second page of my search? This may seem insignificant, but this is a daily struggle I find myself facing. The
struggle between wanting to write the best possible piece of code versus wanting to simply _make it work_. As of recently I have shifted my mentality to a _great is good,
but good is good enough_ mindset. I strive to get my application functioning properly as I figure I can always go back and make improvements over time.

I refer to the internet for solutions to my problems literally every couple of minutes. So what may seem like an insignificant skill to most is actually an invaluable
skill to a coder. It is a skill to be able to find the proper source of information. It is a skill to figure out which method of analyzing that information works best for
you: do you read it word for word or do you skim for only what you are looking for? It is a skill to take that information and implement it within your code with your
specific objectives in mind. So while I say I struggle with my Google searches lightheartedly, please do not take my humor for insincerity because I assure you when it
comes to coding...Googling is a requirement.
